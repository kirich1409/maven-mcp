# License Compliance

Aggregate SPDX licenses across the full transitive closure of one or more root Maven GAVs
and flag risky/incompatible licenses against a project license posture or an explicit
disallow list.

## Steps

1. Parse root dependencies the user wants scanned — `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`
   (version required per entry; capped at 20 roots).

2. Ask (if not already stated) which policy applies:
   - `projectLicense` — an SPDX id or license name; a **permissive** posture (or omitted
     `projectLicense`) defaults to disallowing `strong-copyleft`, `network-copyleft`, and
     `proprietary`.
   - `disallow` — explicit SPDX ids and/or category names; when set, this **replaces** the
     default disallow set entirely rather than adding to it.

3. Call **`check_license_compliance`** with `dependencies`, optional `projectLicense`,
   optional `disallow`.

4. Present per-node verdicts: `ok` / `review` / `violation`, with
   `groupId:artifactId:version`, `spdxId`/`license`, `category`, `viaTransitive` (direct vs
   transitive), and `reason`. Group by verdict, `violation` first. Missing/unrecognized
   license metadata is `review`, never a silent `ok` — present it as needing a human look,
   not as clean.

## Known limitations

This is a heuristic policy signal, not legal advice — say so when a violation is reported.
Deps.dev package-metadata SPDX only; per-root graphs are resolved in isolation (same
caveats as `/transitive-graph` and `/dependency-conflicts`); a compound SPDX expression
(`A OR B`) or an operator beyond a single known id degrades to `review`.

## Constraints and non-goals

- Not for a single dependency's own license with no transitive scan needed — use
  `/dependency-license`.

## Fallback (MCP unavailable only)

No practical manual fallback — walking a full transitive graph and fetching per-node
license metadata by hand does not scale. Tell the user this check is unavailable rather
than approximating it from the direct dependency's license alone.
