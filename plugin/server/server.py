    Never reads credentials from build files. Never logs secret values.

    Credential-misbinding guard (GHSA-m2hv-xh72-cccw): a secret must only
    ever be sent to the host it was configured for. Host-keyed resolution
    (``ident == host``) is safe unconditionally — the identifier is derived
    from the SAME ``url`` the request targets, so it cannot diverge from the

    build file controls independently of ``url``, so it is only honored when
    the user has pinned that name to this exact destination host via
    ``MAVEN_REPO_<NAME>_HOST`` (see ``_name_pin_host``); otherwise it is
    skipped (logged once, secret-free) and resolution falls through to the
    next candidate (typically the host).

    Mirror exception (#294 regression fix, R2b): when ``entry["mirrored"]``
    is set, ``entry["name"]`` is the settings.xml mirror's OWN ``<id>`` and
    ``entry["url"]`` is the mirror's OWN url — both written by

    own ``~/.m2/settings.xml`` / ``~/.gradle/init.gradle*``, never from the
    scanned project's build files). That name is therefore just as trusted
    as the host, not an untrusted build-file string, so it does not need a
    ``_HOST`` pin. This key is set in exactly one place in this module —
    ``_apply_mirror_to_entry`` — always alongside that url/name overwrite.
    No parser that reads the scanned project's build files (Gradle/Maven repo

# urllib's default HTTPRedirectHandler forwards every header except
# Content-Length/Content-Type to a redirect target verbatim (including
# Authorization, even cross-host or on an https->http downgrade), and only
# rejects a redirect scheme outside {http, https, ftp, ''} — it never
# inspects the destination host at all. A private repo (or api.github.com
# with GITHUB_TOKEN) that 302s can therefore leak credentials to another
# host, downgrade to plaintext, or steer a follow-up request at a cloud
# metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) or link-local address.

# Proxy-Authorization deliberately excluded: urllib.request.Request stores it
# capitalized as "Proxy-authorization" (Request.add_header does key.capitalize()),
# so remove_header("Proxy-Authorization") here would never match anyway — and
# even if it did, proxy auth is scoped to the PROXY connection, not the target
# host, so it is correct for it to persist across a redirect through the same
# proxy (R2d cleanup — this key was a no-op, not a security gap).

    previous ``1 + P*(1+C)`` separate ``gradlew`` invocations (a probe run per
    module, then one ``dependencies --configuration`` run per selected
    configuration, plus one ``buildEnvironment`` run) with exactly one.

    Only first-level (direct) dependencies are dumped, matching the old text
    parser exactly: ``_parse_gradle_dependencies_stdout`` only ever matched
    depth-0 tree lines (``^(?:\\+---|\\\\---)``, no leading ``|`` indent), so
    transitive dependencies nested under a direct one were never captured
    before either — this is existing behavior being preserved, not a new
    limitation. Uses ``configuration.incoming.resolutionResult`` (never throws
    ResolveException — unresolved dependencies simply surface as
    ``UnresolvedDependencyResult`` nodes instead of failing the graph) rather
    than the legacy ``resolvedConfiguration``/``lenientConfiguration`` API:
    empirically, the legacy API triggers a Gradle-9 deprecation warning
    ("incompatible with Gradle 10") on a real sample build, while
    ``resolutionResult`` does not — so this is also a forward-compat win, not
    only a perf one. It additionally distinguishes project (module-to-module)
    dependencies from external module ones via
    ``ProjectComponentIdentifier``/``ModuleComponentIdentifier`` — the old
    parser explicitly skipped ``project :x`` tokens, and naively resolving via
    the legacy API's ``firstLevelModuleDependencies`` reintroduces exactly
    that as a synthetic ``{rootGroup}:{subprojectName}:unspecified`` GAV,
    which is filtered out here to preserve the old output shape exactly. Each
    configuration is wrapped in its own try/catch for per-module,
    per-configuration failure isolation, the same isolation the old
    per-invocation-per-config subprocess model gave. No untrusted data is
    interpolated into this script (module/paths are read from the live
    ``Project`` graph inside Groovy, not templated from Python), so it carries

    """Heuristic typosquat/popularity signal for an ``exists`` coordinate.

    A candidate to verify, not a verdict -- false-positive-prone by
    construction (a legitimately new/niche library also has a low version
    count). Framed as cautiously as `suggestions`. Never folded into
    `likelyHallucination`, which stays absent-only (separate field, separate
    computation, no shared code path).

    ``gated_calls`` is a per-batch counter (a 1-element list used as a mutable
    cell) SHARED across every coordinate in one `handle_verify_coordinates`
    call. Callers MUST pass a list created FRESH at the top of that call, never
    a module-level global: server.py runs as a long-lived stdio process, so a
    global counter would accumulate gated-call usage across the entire process
    lifetime instead of resetting per batch.

    ``gated_calls_lock`` (#400): the per-coordinate fan-out in
    ``handle_verify_coordinates`` now runs on a ThreadPoolExecutor, so this
    function can be entered concurrently by multiple worker threads sharing
    the SAME ``gated_calls`` cell -- an unguarded check-then-increment would
    let the total exceed ``MAX_GATED_SOLR_CALLS_PER_BATCH`` (a real, documented
    load-safety cap, not just a perf nicety). Optional and defaults to
    ``None`` so direct single-threaded callers (tests exercising this counter
    in isolation) are unaffected; ``handle_verify_coordinates`` always passes
    a real lock created fresh alongside ``gated_calls``.

    Coverage boundary: `group_mismatch` targets identical/near-identical-name
    impersonation (`GROUP_MISMATCH_SIMILARITY`, near-identical, not merely
    similar). `low_version_count` alone is the fallback signal for an attacker
    who ALSO edits the artifactId (a 1-edit-distance typo), which may score
    below the similarity threshold.

    Accepted residual risk: `group_mismatch` and `recent_first_publish` are
    BOTH gated behind the same `low_version_count` precondition, so an attacker
    can publish a few trivial version bumps immediately after a typosquat lands
    (Central has no publish review gate) to push `version_count` above
    `LOW_VERSION_COUNT_THRESHOLD` and suppress ALL of Layer 2 at once -- for
    exactly the OSSF-reporting-lag window Layer 2 exists to cover. Accepted,
    not re-architected: Layer 2 stays advisory-only (`ask`, never `deny`), so
    Layer 1's authoritative `deny` path (independent of version count) is
    unaffected.
